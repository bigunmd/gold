## GOLD / DSH integration contract

GOLD governs this skill and all supporting resources. Preserve approved scope, collaboration style, runtime plan mode, authorization, current verification evidence and C4 assessment. A conversational answer settles a design choice; it is not permission to implement, publish or bypass plan mode. Reuse valid approval rather than adding duplicate gates.

- Invoke reusable skills through the Harness skill tool. User-only skills (`disable-model-invocation: true`) stay user-invoked through the skill picker; suggest them instead of auto-loading them. Slash names denote skills, not installed native commands.
- Use Harness read, glob and grep tools for file inspection and ask_user_question for user-owned decisions. Use available subagent tools for delegation, with scoped briefs, ownership and parent verification; never assume Claude Task tools, worktrees, browser tools, tracker CLIs or credentials are available. If delegation is unavailable, disclose it and perform bounded independent passes.
- Never automatically commit, push, merge, reset, delete worktrees, create/publish PRs, change labels, close tickets or deploy. Obtain explicit action/target approval and load GOLD Git policy before Git mutations. Prepare drafts or proposals when publication is not authorized. Review findings do not authorize repairs.
- File writes, instrumentation, experiments and setup edits require scope covering their effects. Local plans, investigations, specs/tickets, research, handoffs and learning state default to gitignored repository-root .gold/ (not .scratch/, OS temp or tracked notes); read-only requests get inline reports. Shared ADRs, glossary and runbooks may stay tracked when explicitly approved. Preserve existing approved project conventions and never force-add local records or store secrets in them.
- Read existing project tracker/domain configuration when relevant. If missing, suggest setup-matt-pocock-skills and clarify the target; do not auto-run setup, invent a GitHub default, authenticate or create labels. Integration installation does not configure any project.
- Ponytail governs simplicity, not completeness: retain required tests and validation; deep modules and design alternatives must solve a demonstrated problem, not add speculative layers. Present HTML artifacts through Harness present; do not spawn replacement GUI servers or assume OS open commands work.

The contract above takes precedence over conflicting steps in the adapted upstream text and referenced resources.


# Test-Driven Development

TDD is the red → green loop. This skill is the reference that makes that loop produce tests worth keeping: what a good test is, where tests go, the anti-patterns, and the rules of the loop. Every section applies on every cycle: consult them before and during the loop, not after.

When exploring the codebase, read `GLOSSARY.md` (if it exists) so test names and interface vocabulary match the project's domain language, and respect ADRs in the area you're touching.

## What a good test is

Tests verify behavior through public interfaces, not implementation details. Code can change entirely; tests shouldn't. A good test reads like a specification: "user can checkout with valid cart" tells you exactly what capability exists, and it survives refactors because it doesn't care about internal structure.

See [tests.md](tests.md) for examples and [mocking.md](mocking.md) for mocking guidelines.

## Seams: where tests go

A **seam** is the public boundary you test at: the interface where you observe behavior without reaching inside. Tests live at seams, never against internals.

**Test only at pre-agreed seams.** Before writing any test, write down the seams under test and confirm them with the user. No test is written at an unconfirmed seam. You can't test everything, so agreeing the seams up front is how testing effort lands on the critical paths and complex logic instead of every edge case.

Ask: "What's the public interface, and which seams should we test?" Give each proposed seam a one-line note on what it catches and what it misses.

When the shape of that interface is itself in question (how deep the module is, where the seam belongs, what the interface should expose), call the Skill tool with "codebase-design" for the vocabulary. It is the shared source of the module, interface, depth, seam, adapter, leverage and locality terms, and it is a reference to consult, not a session to run.

## Anti-patterns

- **Implementation-coupled**: mocks internal collaborators, tests private methods, or verifies through a side channel (querying the database instead of using the interface). The tell: the test breaks when you refactor but behavior hasn't changed.
- **Tautological**: the assertion recomputes the expected value the way the code does (`expect(add(a, b)).toBe(a + b)`, a snapshot derived by hand the same way, a constant asserted equal to itself), so it passes by construction and can never disagree with the code. Expected values must come from an independent source of truth: a known-good literal, a worked example, the spec.
- **Horizontal slicing**: writing all tests first, then all implementation. Bulk tests verify _imagined_ behavior: you test the _shape_ of things rather than user-facing behavior, the tests go insensitive to real changes, and you commit to test structure before understanding the implementation. Work in **vertical slices** instead: one test → one implementation → repeat, each test a **tracer bullet** that responds to what the last cycle taught you.

## Rules of the loop

- **Red before green.** Write the failing test first, then only enough code to pass it. Don't anticipate future tests or add speculative features.
- **One slice at a time.** One seam, one test, one minimal implementation per cycle.
- **Refactoring is not part of the loop.** It belongs to the review stage (see the `code-review` skill), not the red → green implementation cycle.
