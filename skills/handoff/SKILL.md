## GOLD / DSH integration contract

GOLD governs this skill and all supporting resources. Preserve approved scope, collaboration style, runtime plan mode, authorization, current verification evidence and C4 assessment. A conversational answer settles a design choice; it is not permission to implement, publish or bypass plan mode. Reuse valid approval rather than adding duplicate gates.

- Invoke reusable skills through the Harness skill tool. User-only skills (`disable-model-invocation: true`) stay user-invoked through the skill picker; suggest them instead of auto-loading them. Slash names denote skills, not installed native commands.
- Use Harness read, glob and grep tools for file inspection and ask_user_question for user-owned decisions. Use available subagent tools for delegation, with scoped briefs, ownership and parent verification; never assume Claude Task tools, worktrees, browser tools, tracker CLIs or credentials are available. If delegation is unavailable, disclose it and perform bounded independent passes.
- Never automatically commit, push, merge, reset, delete worktrees, create/publish PRs, change labels, close tickets or deploy. Obtain explicit action/target approval and load GOLD Git policy before Git mutations. Prepare drafts or proposals when publication is not authorized. Review findings do not authorize repairs.
- File writes, instrumentation, experiments and setup edits require scope covering their effects. Local plans, investigations, specs/tickets, research, handoffs and learning state default to gitignored repository-root .gold/ (not .scratch/, OS temp or tracked notes); read-only requests get inline reports. Shared ADRs, glossary and runbooks may stay tracked when explicitly approved. Preserve existing approved project conventions and never force-add local records or store secrets in them.
- Read existing project tracker/domain configuration when relevant. If missing, suggest setup-matt-pocock-skills and clarify the target; do not auto-run setup, invent a GitHub default, authenticate or create labels. Integration installation does not configure any project.
- Ponytail governs simplicity, not completeness: retain required tests and validation; deep modules and design alternatives must solve a demonstrated problem, not add speculative layers. Present HTML artifacts through Harness present; do not spawn replacement GUI servers or assume OS open commands work.

The contract above takes precedence over conflicting steps in the adapted upstream text and referenced resources.


Write a handoff document summarising the current conversation so a fresh agent can continue the work. Save to the temporary directory of the user's OS (`$TMPDIR`, else `/tmp`; `%TEMP%` on Windows) - not the current workspace.

Include a "suggested skills" section in the document, naming which skills the next agent should call the Skill tool for.

Do not duplicate content already captured in other artifacts (specs, plans, ADRs, issues, commits, diffs). Reference them by path or URL instead.

Redact any sensitive information, such as API keys, passwords, or personally identifiable information.

If the user passed arguments, treat them as a description of what the next session will focus on and tailor the doc accordingly.
