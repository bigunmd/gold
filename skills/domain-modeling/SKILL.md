## GOLD / DSH integration contract

GOLD governs this skill and all supporting resources. Preserve approved scope, collaboration style, runtime plan mode, authorization, current verification evidence and C4 assessment. A conversational answer settles a design choice; it is not permission to implement, publish or bypass plan mode. Reuse valid approval rather than adding duplicate gates.

- Invoke reusable skills through the Harness skill tool. User-only skills (`disable-model-invocation: true`) stay user-invoked through the skill picker; suggest them instead of auto-loading them. Slash names denote skills, not installed native commands.
- Use Harness read, glob and grep tools for file inspection and ask_user_question for user-owned decisions. Use available subagent tools for delegation, with scoped briefs, ownership and parent verification; never assume Claude Task tools, worktrees, browser tools, tracker CLIs or credentials are available. If delegation is unavailable, disclose it and perform bounded independent passes.
- Never automatically commit, push, merge, reset, delete worktrees, create/publish PRs, change labels, close tickets or deploy. Obtain explicit action/target approval and load GOLD Git policy before Git mutations. Prepare drafts or proposals when publication is not authorized. Review findings do not authorize repairs.
- File writes, instrumentation, experiments and setup edits require scope covering their effects. Local plans, investigations, specs/tickets, research, handoffs and learning state default to gitignored repository-root .gold/ (not .scratch/, OS temp or tracked notes); read-only requests get inline reports. Shared ADRs, glossary and runbooks may stay tracked when explicitly approved. Preserve existing approved project conventions and never force-add local records or store secrets in them.
- Read existing project tracker/domain configuration when relevant. If missing, suggest setup-matt-pocock-skills and clarify the target; do not auto-run setup, invent a GitHub default, authenticate or create labels. Integration installation does not configure any project.
- Ponytail governs simplicity, not completeness: retain required tests and validation; deep modules and design alternatives must solve a demonstrated problem, not add speculative layers. Present HTML artifacts through Harness present; do not spawn replacement GUI servers or assume OS open commands work.

The contract above takes precedence over conflicting steps in the adapted upstream text and referenced resources.


# Domain Modeling

Actively build and sharpen the project's domain model as you design. This is the *active* discipline: challenging terms, inventing edge-case scenarios, and writing the glossary and decisions down the moment they crystallise. (Merely *reading* `GLOSSARY.md` for vocabulary is not this skill: that's a one-line habit any skill can do. This skill is for when you're changing the model, not just consuming it.)

## File structure

Most repos have a single context:

```
/
├── GLOSSARY.md
├── docs/
│   └── adr/
│       ├── 0001-event-sourced-orders.md
│       └── 0002-postgres-for-write-model.md
└── src/
```

If a `GLOSSARY-MAP.md` exists at the root, the repo has multiple contexts. The map points to where each one lives:

```
/
├── GLOSSARY-MAP.md
├── docs/
│   └── adr/                          ← system-wide decisions
├── src/
│   ├── ordering/
│   │   ├── GLOSSARY.md
│   │   └── docs/adr/                 ← context-specific decisions
│   └── billing/
│       ├── GLOSSARY.md
│       └── docs/adr/
```

Create files lazily: only when you have something to write. If no `GLOSSARY.md` exists, create one when the first term is resolved. If no `docs/adr/` exists, create it when the first ADR is needed.

## During the session

### Challenge against the glossary

When the user uses a term that conflicts with the existing language in `GLOSSARY.md`, call it out immediately. "Your glossary defines 'cancellation' as X, but you seem to mean Y. Which is it?"

### Sharpen fuzzy language

When the user uses vague or overloaded terms, propose a precise canonical term. "You're saying 'account': do you mean the Customer or the User? Those are different things."

### Discuss concrete scenarios

When domain relationships are being discussed, stress-test them with specific scenarios. Invent scenarios that probe edge cases and force the user to be precise about the boundaries between concepts.

### Cross-reference with code

When the user states how something works, check whether the code agrees. If you find a contradiction, surface it: "Your code cancels entire Orders, but you just said partial cancellation is possible. Which is right?"

### Update GLOSSARY.md inline

When a term is resolved, update `GLOSSARY.md` right there. Don't batch these up: capture them as they happen. Use the format in [GLOSSARY-FORMAT.md](./GLOSSARY-FORMAT.md).

`GLOSSARY.md` should be totally devoid of implementation details. Do not treat `GLOSSARY.md` as a spec, a scratch pad, or a repository for implementation decisions. It is a glossary and nothing else.

### Offer ADRs sparingly

Only offer to create an ADR when all three are true:

1. **Hard to reverse**: the cost of changing your mind later is meaningful
2. **Surprising without context**: a future reader will wonder "why did they do it this way?"
3. **The result of a real trade-off**: there were genuine alternatives and you picked one for specific reasons

If any of the three is missing, skip the ADR. Use the format in [ADR-FORMAT.md](./ADR-FORMAT.md).
