description: Build a throwaway prototype to answer a design question. Use when the user wants to sanity-check whether a state model or logic feels right, or explore what a UI should look like.

## GOLD / DSH integration contract

GOLD governs this skill and all supporting resources. Preserve approved scope, collaboration style, runtime plan mode, authorization, current verification evidence and C4 assessment. A conversational answer settles a design choice; it is not permission to implement, publish or bypass plan mode. Reuse valid approval rather than adding duplicate gates.

- Invoke reusable skills through the Harness skill tool. User-only skills (`disable-model-invocation: true`) stay user-invoked through the skill picker; suggest them instead of auto-loading them. Slash names denote skills, not installed native commands.
- Use Harness read, glob and grep tools for file inspection and ask_user_question for user-owned decisions. Use available subagent tools for delegation, with scoped briefs, ownership and parent verification; never assume Claude Task tools, worktrees, browser tools, tracker CLIs or credentials are available. If delegation is unavailable, disclose it and perform bounded independent passes.
- Never automatically commit, push, merge, reset, delete worktrees, create/publish PRs, change labels, close tickets or deploy. Obtain explicit action/target approval and load GOLD Git policy before Git mutations. Prepare drafts or proposals when publication is not authorized. Review findings do not authorize repairs.
- File writes, instrumentation, experiments and setup edits require scope covering their effects. Local plans, investigations, specs/tickets, research, handoffs and learning state default to gitignored repository-root .gold/ (not .scratch/, OS temp or tracked notes); read-only requests get inline reports. Shared ADRs, glossary and runbooks may stay tracked when explicitly approved. Preserve existing approved project conventions and never force-add local records or store secrets in them.
- Read existing project tracker/domain configuration when relevant. If missing, suggest setup-matt-pocock-skills and clarify the target; do not auto-run setup, invent a GitHub default, authenticate or create labels. Integration installation does not configure any project.
- Ponytail governs simplicity, not completeness: retain required tests and validation; deep modules and design alternatives must solve a demonstrated problem, not add speculative layers. Present HTML artifacts through Harness present; do not spawn replacement GUI servers or assume OS open commands work.

The contract above takes precedence over conflicting steps in the adapted upstream text and referenced resources.


# Prototype

A prototype is **throwaway code that answers a question**. The question decides the shape.

## Pick a branch

Identify which question is being answered, using the user's prompt, the surrounding code, or by asking if the user is around:

- **"Does this logic / state model feel right?"** → [LOGIC.md](LOGIC.md). Build a single shareable HTML file (free-play buttons plus tabbed guided walkthroughs) that pushes the state machine through cases that are hard to reason about on paper, and that a non-developer can drive.
- **"What should this look like?"** → [UI.md](UI.md). Generate several radically different UI variations on a single route, switchable via a URL search param and a floating bottom bar.

The two branches produce very different artifacts, so getting this wrong wastes the whole prototype. If the question is genuinely ambiguous and the user isn't reachable, default to whichever branch better matches the surrounding code (a backend module → logic; a page or component → UI) and state the assumption at the top of the prototype.

## Rules that apply to both

1. **Throwaway from day one, and clearly marked as such.** Locate the prototype code close to where it will actually be used (next to the module or page it's prototyping for) so context is obvious, but name it so a casual reader can see it's a prototype, not production. For throwaway UI routes, obey whatever routing convention the project already uses; don't invent a new top-level structure.
2. **Trivial to run.** A UI prototype starts from one command in the project's task runner: `pnpm <name>`, `python <path>`, `bun <path>`, etc. A logic demo is a single HTML file the user double-clicks. Either way, no thinking required to start it.
3. **No persistence by default.** State lives in memory. Persistence is the thing the prototype is _checking_, not something it should depend on. If the question explicitly involves a database, hit a scratch DB or a local file with a clear "PROTOTYPE, wipe me" name.
4. **Skip the polish.** No tests, no error handling beyond what makes the prototype _runnable_, no abstractions. The point is to learn something fast.
5. **Surface the state.** After every action (logic) or on every variant switch (UI), print or render the full relevant state so the user can see what changed.
6. **Capture it when done.** Fold any validated decision into the real code, then capture the prototype itself as a **primary source**: commit it to a throwaway branch, out of main, and leave a context pointer to that branch on the implementation issue. Capture the answer too (the verdict and the question it settled) in the issue or a commit. The main branch keeps only the validated decision.
